# RandPass

RandPass is a simple vanilla javascript based random password generator that runs entirely in the browser. It does not use 3rd party packages nor APIs. It is designed around the [`Crypto.getRandomValues()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/getRandomValues) function supported by all major browsers.
